#LifeHelper

This is an Ionic app made with my android phone in mind. I currently have two sub-apps here:
 - a restaurant list with name, location, date, type of restaurant, ratings, price and commentary, equipped with a search bar and data sorting by parameters.
 - and a weight and workout tracker with an area chart and a stacked bar graphs (respectively) with  1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 1 year option to visualize the data.
